Doctor’s Clinic

A clinic has 4 consulting rooms and several doctors. The clinic functions between 7 AM and 19 PM and
has each consulting room assigned to a doctor. When the doctor’s shift is over, another doctor will take
over the consulting room.
A doctor can be identified by first name, last name, age and identification number. Each doctor can
consult a single patient at a time and he can work for maximum 7 hours a day.
A patient can be identified by first name, last name, age and the reason why he came to the doctor.
The reason can be: consultation, treatment or prescription.
In order to provide better healthcare, the clinic has a categorizing system for patients using the age as
a differentiating factor, in order to determine the consultation order:
- Children: 0-1 years
- Pupil: 1-7 years
- Student: 7-18 years
- Adult: > 18 years
According to the consultation’s reason, each patient will stay in the consulting room for a predefined
period of time and he will pay a predefined fee:
- Consultation: 30 minutes, 50 RON
- Prescription: 20 minutes, 20 RON
- Treatment: 40 minutes, 35 RON
